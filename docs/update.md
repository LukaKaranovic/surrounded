## Key revisions since phase 4

Almost nothing from past documents has changed other than the implementation of our new world boundary using the seeking comet rather than an asteroid belt. Big changes to the boss requirements are in talks but are not yet official and haven't been implemeneted, so changes will be made there likely in phase 6.

### Changes and updates to the standards and processes (standards.md)
* Updated list of documents to be maintained to include phase 5 documents.
* Added information about our user acceptance tests that are located in our testing branch in the 'version control' section.

### Changes and updates to the product requirements (requirements.md)
* Organized the 'Map and Terrain' subsection into 3 sections to improve readability.
* Replaced world boundary section that talks about asteroid belt to talk about our new would boundary system with the comet.

### Changes and updates to the logical design (logicaldesign.md)
No changes or updates were made to the logical design this phase.
