## <a name="intro"></a>Project intro

A top-down shoot-em-up roguelike/lite with a space combat and asteroid mining theme. The player moves around in 2D space to fire on enemies which approach from various surrounding randomly generated spawn points (likely to appear from screen). The main challenge will be making the gameplay feel addicting yet rewarding and somehow let the player feel as if they’ve made real progress from gaining XP from in-game interaction.

## <a name="philosophy"></a>Team philosophy

What are the core goals, priorities, and philosophies of the team this term

Each of us as individuals have experience playing different genres of video games. Some of us have up to thousands of hours in our said favourite games. This made it easy for us to have the perspective of the player and help integrate ideas so we could devise what could be a system for enjoyable gameplay. As some of us range in skill levels in programming, we made sure our team dynamic never faltered despite unfamiliarity of game engines, and since the project itself is a topic close to home.

From a team perspective, we want to ensure an environment where all of us can meet deadlines yet also have a good amount of fun with the challenges that may come our way, these being:

Weekly check-ins with each other’s progression and potential problems
Being able to communicate technical difficulties with each and every programmer
Daily communication within the discord server to take on specific tasks or to discuss ideas
Reviewing documentation and code base regularly to ensure quality
Creating a fun environment which doesn’t exclude members and is also effective
Having a vocal yet responsive opinion with each other without harsh judgements

## <a name="roles"></a>Team roles/responsibilities

The team’s roles and responsibilities were decided while making this charter in a call. Everyone got their say in what area they wanted to be most responsible for.

Our idea of roles is that each area of the game's development will be a potential role (enemy design, map design, item design, balancing, etc.). The person with a role is not going to be the one who does everything under that area of game development, but is moreso the director for anything under that category. This director role will be responsible for making sure everything in that area is up to standard, there is enough content, and that the deadlines for that area are met.

For tasks, we will have a Kanban board on Github Projects with tasks organised by priority. Group members will take a task from the to-do-list, notify the group, and then work on that task until it is finished. Once it is finished, they will check with the director of the thing they designed to make sure it is up to standard. Directors will be responsible for adding all tasks related to their role. This way everyone gets involved in the game development process in more than just one area. 

It is also taken into consideration that certain roles do not fall under this system, such as version control lead, presentation lead, and playtesting. The people with those roles will carry the responsibility (with assistance of others in the group) of those tasks.

## <a name="meetings"></a>Planned team meeting time(s) and communication plans

We plan to communicate through a combination of discord calls and meetings in person throughout the course of the semester.

We also have a discord server with channels for specific purposes, which is our main method of communication, as finding common meeting times was difficult for our group.

Primary weekly meetings will occur from Tuesday night 6:00PM to 9:00PM, and a shorter meeting on Friday afternoon. For a majority of our meets, Tuesday’s meeting will be over Discord and Friday will be in person.

Each Tuesday meeting will feature brief overviews of everyone's work based on their designated roles in the project. This will include any foreseeable/present problems which need to be addressed, such as bugs, feature implementation, and possible scope alterations.

**Meeting times:**

 - Tuesday Evening ~6-9PM (variable call times) - Discord Call (Connor can't attend)
 - Friday 1:30-2:30PM - In-person (All members)

**Meeting rules and processes:**

The Tuesday meetings will be used to judge and scale various wants and needs for our projects deadlines and for general implementation discussion. We will also have a lead who can keep track of the total requirements for our project, but wish to be proactive within our discord enough to be fully updated. 

In the likely case someone misses a time block for a meeting, said person will be informed of any changes or problems/solutions that need to be checked and reviewed for their respective role. If the problem persists, we will have a general team meeting before contacting the instructor.

## <a name="deadlines"></a>Deadlines and deliverables

The Tuesday meetings will be for scoping out weekly to-dos Git-Hub Projects, with some of Friday’s meetings and extra weekends being dedicated to project specifics which may need extra time and focus. As a team we agreed to help each other meet deadlines 3 days in advance and have a summary of work (from each respective role) be updated bi-weekly in our discord through a list. 

For documentation, we let our organisational lead be the one doing checks days in advance before submission to ensure completion. For gameplay fixes and code we will let our game balance lead and main dev be ensuring production as planned. As for the presentation lead we will give them the respective presentation duties and have an all clear from everyone to be aware of what should be presented.

In the instance we have missing deadlines, others may need to sacrifice extra time to help other team members. If there is an instance where workload is given in unfair distributions, we will address this as a team in a meeting.

## <a name="confres"></a>Conflict resolution scheme

We have reached a verbal agreement that issues would be resolved within a call, if others aren't giving enough work done for the project or have lacked fundamental contribution, we will have an open-minded discussion and resolve this with a unanimous decision from the other members to regard a specific member lacking effort.

## <a name="ai"></a>Team AI policies

Our team has decided not to allow AI because we believe the use of AI would hinder our creativity and learning process throughout the creation of the project. While we do think AI is good for asking ambiguous questions, we would like to restrict its use to a minimum in order to have a clearer path to success that aligns with our group structure, rather than relying on a band-aid.

## <a name="ip"></a>Intellectual property rights

All members of the team are equal as holders towards IP rights for this project. 

We have unanimously agreed that this project can be used for resumes and portfolios outside of the class. Without the necessity for consent.

## <a name="strweak"></a>Discussion of team strengths/weaknesses

Strengths of the team: 
* We have good team chemistry as we all know each other from previous classes
* We all have a background in gaming and are interested in game design
* We have clear communication and are able to keep everyone on the same page
* We have a clear goal of what we want to achieve for this project
Weaknesses of the team: 
* Not many meeting times due to conflicting schedules
* Because we get along well, sometimes we can get distracted and cause each other to lose productivity
* There are some skill differences between the team members
* Lack of background using Unity and C#
